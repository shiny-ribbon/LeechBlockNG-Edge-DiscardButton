# LeechBlock NG Edge (On-screen Remaining Time Button)

[![Awesome Humane Tech](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humanetech-community/awesome-humane-tech/main/humane-tech-badge.svg?sanitize=true)](https://github.com/humanetech-community/awesome-humane-tech)

Like it says on the tin, this is a small change made to Leechblock to add the Remaining Time Discard option on-screen.
Only two files are changed, "content.css" and "content.js". As well as manifest.json for loading the extension unpacked. Use just those if you want to for example make a firefox or chrome version
